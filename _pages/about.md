My name is Marlyn Ngembus and I  am a senior at Virginia tech studying computer engineering, with an emphasis in networking and cybersecurity. I am also persuing a minor in Peace Studies and Social Justice. I am passionate about expanding my knowledge of the subject. I have gained experience in leadership and teamwork through my coursework, organizations, and programs I have participated in. I am intent on equipping myself with the necessary skills needed to excel in this industry.
